    'Based on your racing data analysis, I can see several areas for improvement:
    
    1. **Consistency**: Your lap time variation is 2.3 seconds, which suggests room for improvement in maintaining consistent pace.
    
    2. **Sector 2 Performance**: You're losing 0.8 seconds on average in the middle sector compared to your best times.
    
    3. **Braking Points**: The telemetry shows late braking in turns 3 and 7, which affects corner exit speed.
    
    **Specific Recommendations:**
    - Practice threshold braking to find consistent braking points
    - Focus on smooth steering inputs through sector 2
    - Work on earlier turn-in for better corner exit acceleration
    
    Would you like me to analyze specific corners or compare with your previous sessions?'
