"""
Tire Grip and Friction Circle Analysis Service for Assetto Corsa Competizione

This service provides comprehensive tire grip analysis and friction circle utilization
estimation using machine learning models. It extracts features related to:

- Tire grip estimation based on physics telemetry
- Friction circle utilization (how close the car is to the limit)  
- Weight transfer analysis
- Predictive load calculations
- Tire performance degradation
- Optimal grip windows

The extracted features are designed to be inserted back into telemetry data for enhanced AI analysis.

    PURPOSE
    -------
    Provide purely physics-derived, driver-behavior neutral enrichment of telemetry data with
    tire grip utilization, friction circle occupancy, weight transfer, slip efficiency, and
    related indicators. These enriched features are intended to feed downstream generalized
    models (e.g., transformers for imitation / reasoning) without leaking individual driver
    control habits (throttle modulation, braking aggressiveness, steering style) or car identity.

    DESIGN PRINCIPLES
    -----------------
    2. Only vehicle dynamics & tire state signals are used; control inputs (brake, gas, steer, gear)
       are excluded to avoid encoding behavior profiles.
    4. Safe defaults and bounded scaling (tanh, clipping) to stabilize downstream learning.
